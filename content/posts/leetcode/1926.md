**1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze**
+ Hardness: \\(\color{orange}\textsf{Medium}\\)
+ Ralated Topics: `Array`、`Breadth-First Search`、`Matrix`

### 一、題目
You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (**0-indexed**) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol]` denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the nearest exit from the `entrance`. An **exit** is defined as an **empty cell** that is at the **border** of the `maze`. The `entrance` **does not count** as an exit.

Return *the ***number of steps*** in the shortest path from the `entrance` to the nearest exit, or `-1` if no such path exists*.

**Example 1:**  
+ **Input:** maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
+ **Output:** 1
+ **Explanation:** There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].  
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].  
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.  
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.  
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.  
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.  

**Example 2:**
+ **Input:** maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]
+ **Output:** 2
+ **Explanation:** There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].  
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.  
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].  
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.  
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.  

**Example 3:**
+ **Input:** maze = [[".","+"]], entrance = [0,0]  
+ **Output:** -1  
+ **Explanation**: There are no exits in this maze.  

**Constraints:**
+ `maze.length == m`
+ `maze[i].length == n`
+ `1 <= m, n <= 100`
+ `maze[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'+'`.
+ `entrance.length == 2`
+ `0 <= entrancerow < m`
+ `0 <= entrancecol < n`
+ `entrance` will always be an empty cell.

### 二、分析
+ 經典的 `bfs` 題型，套用框架：
    ```C++
    queue<Point> q;
    int step = 0;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int sz = q.size()
        while (sz--) {
            auto curr = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (isEnd) return step;
            for (options) {
                if (!excludedOptions) continue;
                q.push(option);
                visited.insert(option);
            }
        }
        cnt++;
    }
    ```
+ 注意記錄拜訪的時間點，若是在 `q.pop()` 時才記錄拜訪，有可以造成大量重複的點進入到佇列中，故必須在 `q.push()` 時就記錄拜訪。
+ 需要排除起始點，故需要排除 `cnt == 1`。

### 三、解題
#### 1. BFS
+ Time complexity: \\(O(m\times n)\\)
+ Space complexity: \\(O(1)\\)
```C++
int dirc[4][2] = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
int nearestExit(vector<vector<char>>& maze, vector<int>& e) {
    int m = maze.size(), n = maze[0].size();
    queue<pair<int,int>> q;
    q.push({e[0], e[1]});
    maze[e[0]][e[1]] = '+';
    int cnt = 0;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int sz = q.size();
        while (sz--){
            auto curr = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (cnt > 0 && (curr.first == 0 || curr.first == m-1 || curr.second == 0 || curr.second == n-1)) return cnt;
            for (auto d : dirc) {
                int row = curr.first + d[0];
                int col = curr.second + d[1];
                if (row < 0 || row >= m || col < 0 || col >= n || maze[row][col] != '.') continue;
                q.push({row, col});
                maze[row][col] = '+';
            }
        }
        cnt++;
    }
    return -1;
}
```
