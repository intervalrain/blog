**2136. Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom**
+ Hardness: \\(\color{red}\textsf{Hard}\\)
+ Ralated Topics: `Array`、`Greedy`、`Sorting`
---
### 一、題目
You have `n` flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed take time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `plantTime` and `growTime`, of length `n` each:
+ `plantTime[i]` is the number of **full days** it takes you to **plant** the `ith` seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You **do not** have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete **until** you have worked `plantTime[i]` days on planting it in total.
+ `growTime[i]` is the number of **full days** it takes the `ith` seed to grow after being completely planted. **After** the last day of its growth, the flower **blooms** and stays bloomed forever.
From the beginning of day `0`, you can plant the seeds in **any** order.  
Return *the* ***earliest*** *possible day where* ***all*** *seeds are blooming*.

**Example 1:**  
![growplant1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/21/1.png)
+ **Input:** plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]
+ **Output:** 9
+ **Explanation:** The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.  
One optimal way is:  
On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.  
On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.  
On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.  
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.  

**Example 2:**
![growplant2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/21/2.png)
+ **Input:** plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
+ **Output:** 9
+ **Explanation:** The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.  
One optimal way is:  
On day 1, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.  
On days 0 and 3, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.  
On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.  
On days 6 and 7, plant the 3rd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.  
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.  

**Example 3:**
+ **Input:** plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]
+ **Output:** 2
+ **Explanation:** On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2.  
Thus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.

**Constraints:**
+ `n == plantTime.length == growTime.length`
+ `1 <= n <= 10^5`
+ `1 <= plantTime[i], growTime[i] <= 10^4`

### 二、分析

+ 想像所有花是**先長再種**，其邏輯是長的時間是嚴格連續的，而種的時間是自由彈性的，所以我們先確保盡可能的讓所以花同時有動作在進行，再去彈性安排種的時間，用貪心法求解。
+ 要注意當有一種花的 `growTime` 非常大時，其解會被該物件決定，變為 `growTime[x] + plantTime[x]`，故解不是簡單的 `accumulate(plantTime.begin(), plantTime.end(), 0) + *min_element(growTime.begin(), growTime.end())`。
### 三、解題
#### 1. Greedy
+ Time complexity: \\(O(n\log n)\\)
+ Space complexity: \\(O(n)\\)
```C++
int earliestFullBloom(vector<int>& plantTime, vector<int>& growTime) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> v;
    for (int i = 0; i < plantTime.size(); ++i)
        v.push_back({growTime[i], plantTime[i]});
    sort(begin(v), end(v));
    int res = 0;
    for (auto [g, p] : v)
        res = max(res, g) + p;
    return res;
}
```
