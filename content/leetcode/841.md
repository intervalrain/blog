**841. Keys and Rooms**
+ Hardness: \\(\color{orange}\textsf{Medium}\\)
+ Ralated Topics: `Depth-First Search`、`Breadth-First Search`、`Graph`

### 一、題目
There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and all the rooms are locked except for room `0`. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.  
When you visit a room, you may find a set of **distinct keys** in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.  
Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`, return `true` *if you can visit all the rooms, or* `false` *otherwise*.

**Example 1:**  
+ **Input:** rooms = [[1],[2],[3]]
+ **Output:** true
+ **Explanation:** 
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.  
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.  
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.  
We then visit room 3.  
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.  

**Example 2:**
+ **Input:** rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
+ **Output:** false
+ **Explanation:** We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.

**Constraints:**
+ `n == rooms.length`
+ `2 <= n <= 1000`
+ `0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`
+ `1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000`
+ `0 <= rooms[i][j] < n`
+ All the values of `rooms[i]` are **unique**.

### 二、分析
+ 典型的 `Graph` 問題，利用 `visited` 來記錄拜訪過了沒，並用 `BFS` 來遍歷整個 `Graph`，每次拜訪一間新的 `room` 時，將 `key` 加入到新的佇列中，看是否能能遍歷整個 `graph`。

### 三、解題
#### 1. BFS
+ Time complexity: \\(O(n)\\)
+ Space complexity: \\(O(n)\\)
```C++
bool canVisitAllRooms(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(0);
    int cnt = rooms.size();
    vector<bool> used(rooms.size(), false);
    while (!q.empty()){
        int key = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if (used[key]) continue;
        cnt--;
        if (cnt == 0) break;
        used[key] = true;
        for (int next : rooms[key]){
            if (used[next]) continue;
            q.push(next);
        }
    }
    return cnt == 0;
}
```
