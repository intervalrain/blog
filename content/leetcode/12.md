**12. Integer to Roman**
+ Hardness: \\(\color{orange}\textsf{Medium}\\)
+ Ralated Topics: `Hash Table`、`Math`、`String`
---
### 一、題目
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D`, and `M`.  
\\(\boxed{\begin{array}{ll}
\textbf{Symbol}&\textbf{Value}\\\\
\texttt{I}&1\\\\
\texttt{V}&5\\\\
\texttt{X}&10\\\\
\texttt{L}&50\\\\
\texttt{C}&100\\\\
\texttt{D}&500\\\\
\texttt{M}&1000\\\\
\end{array}}\\)  
For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.  
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
+ `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.  
+ `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.  
+ `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.  
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.  

**Example 1:**  
+ **Input:** num = 3
+ **Output:** "III"
+ **Explanation**: 3 is represented as 3 ones.

**Example 2:**
+ **Input:** num = 58
+ **Output:** "LVIII"
+ **Explanation**: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**  
+ **Input:** num = 1994  
+ **Output:** "MCMXCIV" 
+ **Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.


**Constraints:**
+ `1 <= num <= 3999`

### 二、分析
+ 既然 `num` 的範圍不大，我們可以利用其轉換的規律，直接用 `Array` 去定義。

### 三、解題
#### 1. Math
+ Time complexity: \\(O(1)\\)
+ Space complexity: \\(O(1)\\)
```C++
string intToRoman(int num) {
    string M[] = {"", "M", "MM", "MMM"};
    string C[] = {"", "C", "CC", "CCC", "CD", "D", "DC", "DCC", "DCCC", "CM"};
    string X[] = {"", "X", "XX", "XXX", "XL", "L", "LX", "LXX", "LXXX", "XC"};
    string I[] = {"", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX"};
    return M[num/1000] + C[(num%1000)/100] + X[(num%100)/10] + I[num%10];
}
```
