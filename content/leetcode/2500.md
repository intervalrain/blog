### 一、題目
You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of positive integers.  
Perform the following operation until `grid` becomes empty:  
+ Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.  
+ Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.  
**Note** that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.  
Return *the answer after performing the operations described above*.

**Example 1:**  
![q1ex1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/19/q1ex1.jpg)
+ **Input:** grid = [[1,2,4],[3,3,1]]
+ **Output:** 8
+ **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.  
- In the first operation, we remove 4 from the first row and 3 from the second row (notice that, there are two cells with value 3 and we can remove any of them). We add 4 to the answer.  
- In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.  
- In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.  
The final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.  

**Example 2:**
+ **Input:** grid = [[10]]
+ **Output:** 10
+ **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
- In the first operation, we remove 10 from the first row. We add 10 to the answer.
The final answer = 10.

**Constraints:**
+ `m == grid.length`
+ `n == grid[i].length`
+ `1 <= m, n <= 50`
+ `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

### 二、分析
+ 將每一列的 `vector` 都各自排序後，依題意將每一欄取最大值並累加起來。

### 三、解題
#### 1. Sort
+ Time complexity: \\(O(m\times n\log n)\\)
+ Space complexity: \\(O(1)\\)
```C++
int deleteGreatestValue(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
        auto& row = grid[i];
        sort(row.begin(), row.end());
    }
    int res = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
        int tmp = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            tmp = max(tmp, grid[i][j]);
        }
        res += tmp;
    }
    return res;
}
```
